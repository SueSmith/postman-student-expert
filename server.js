/*
POSTMAN API STARTER

This API works in conjunction with the API Starter collecction in Postman to walk you through API basics.
Import the collection into Postman and send a request to the setup endpoint to begin.

This Glitch app is based on hello-express and low-db.

Below you'll see the code for the endpoints in the API after some initial setup processing
  - each endpoint begins "app." followed by get, post, patch, put, or delete, then the endpoint path, e.g. /cat
